# Menu Drawer 
### Galvanize Capstone Project


#### Concept

Menu Drawer is a restaurant and menu centric, open source platform that will allow users to access a database of menus added by registered users or restaurants in order to view and compare menu items and prices, in order to find local options and choose a best option. Users should be able to search by main ingredient, genre, or dish name - and receive a list of matching results in the form of specific dishes and listed price. 

This concept would ideally serve as a sort of modern solution to the classic "menu drawer" concept.

#### Technologies

This project is powered by React Native to provide a native mobile experience, with the possibility for a future, hybrid desktop application.

User authentication is provided by Auth0.

FireBase RealTime Database powers the back-end, allowing me to take advantage of Google's Serverless Cloud Computing System to improve scalability while maintaining a stable, reliable, and globally secured back-end.

MapQuest API provides local restaurant POS data.

#### The Future

Implementing Redux to allow for central state management, which will also improve scalability and control once more features are implemented.

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) using an API such as Google Vision to allow users to parse menu data via image/text recognition
